    " 1. Implement the Gray-Scott equations in Python, using the spectral method and the method of lines. I've included the outline of my solution below, but feel free to structure your code differently. Use periodic boundary conditions here, because the Fourier transform requires them.\n",
    "- Note that there are several possible ways to solve this problem: (1) exclusively in real-space (it's good practice not to use this approach here, since we already did it above for the Allen-Cahn model), (2) primarily in real-space, but switching to the Fourier domain and back within every call to the diffusion term, or (3) primarily working in the Fourier domain but switching back-and-forth to real space every time within the reaction term. If you opt for the last option, remember to convert your final solution back to real space.\n",
    "- You will likely find the functions `np.fft.fft2()` and `np.fft.ifft2()` very useful here"
